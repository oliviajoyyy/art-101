<h1>Exercise 4 - Alien Creatures</h1>

<p> (<strong>Artist Sketch</strong>)
  In this exercise, I created a class for my Alien creature. 
  This class includes several parent and child functions that draw the alien, along with a some variations 
  such as happy aliens, angry aliens, and different arm poses for each. 
  My class also includes action functions that control the behavior of the alien objects.
  There are two different behavior methods that are interactive through the mouse control. 
  The first changes the behavior by increasing and decreasing the scale of the aliens when the mouse is pressed.
  The other method changes the behavior by rotating the aliens as long as the mouse is moving.
  In addition, I included a function that controls the bounce behavior of the objects.

  <br><br>

  I created an array that creates and stores 15 alien creatures, initialized with a random color,
  rotation, scale, speed, and spinSpeed. 
  As the array is looped through in draw(), each alien is displayed.
  Every other alien displayed will be a happy alien and the rest will be an angry alien.
  All aliens begin at the center of the canvas but spread out to different directions.
  The continous motion of the aliens are the bounce movements across the canvas, the head tilts, 
  and the waving. 

  <br><br>

  Control these behaviors by mouse actions:
  <br>
  - Spin the aliens: move the mouse around
  <br>
  - Increase/decrease alien size: press and hold the mouse
