<h1>Exercise 1</h1>

<p> (<strong>Artist Sketch</strong>) In this exercise, I used nested if statements to determine when and where
  different shapes are drawn on the canavas by the value of the mouse X and Y position. 
  I also used nested for loops to create the grid of ellipses in flashing colors, and to create the line of ellipses that follow
  the mouse Y position.
  I used the height and width properties in the random function to generate numbers up to the height or width, and I used them in 
  the conditions of some for loops to control how far the shapes should be drawn.
  I also used the random function to generate rgb values to input into the color functions fill() and stroke(). 
  I used an overloaded version of the fill() and stroke() functions by passing an alpha value. 
  In addition to using the ellipse(), rect(), and triangle() drawing commands, I also learned how to use quad() and arc().
  I used quad() to draw diamond shapes and arc() to draw a shape that looks like the upper half of an oval.
  <br><br>
  Learning how to use quad() was a bit of a challenge because I had to figure out where the next point of the 
  shape should be relative to its other points for the diamond shape I was trying to make. 
  I like how this exercise turned out because there are many shapes being drawn on the canvas at once with many 
  flashing colors, yet there is still some control given to the user for what gets drawn based on the mouse position.
  <br><br>
  How to use<br>
  Move mouse on the left side of the canvas to: <br> 
  - draw a row of purple ellipses, following the mouseY position<br>
  - draw varying sized oval ellipses in the middle of the canvas height, following the mouseX position<br>
  - change the color of the wicker grid pattern by moving the mouse up and down<br>
  <br>
  Move mouse on upper right side of the canvas to:<br>
  - draw a flashing blue/green ellipse grid on the right side<br>
  - draw green/yellow diamonds on the lower right<br>
  - draw diamonds in a line following the mouseX position<br>
  - draw orange triangles moving towards the mouse<br>
  <br>
  Move mouse on lower right side of the canvas to:<br>
  - draw half ellipses at random positions on the lower part of the canvas
